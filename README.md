MAGIC CUBE SOLVER (WIP)

=================================

BFS Algorithm to solve Rubicks Cube.
Also include basic code to display a cube using OpenGL

=================================

Edit 21 Oct 2013:

- The BFS algorithm has been running for 32 hours, using 4 threads.
- It has explored 2484 712 nodes, checking 2 410 692 possible states, going to depth 5.
- Has the solution take between 1 and 29 moves (source Wikipedia), I don't think it's possible to solve the Rubick's Cube using BFS
- I'll maybe try later on slimpler configuration to check that the code works properly.
